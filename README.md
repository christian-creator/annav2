Agc Needs New Automation (ANNA). I'm tired of doing tedious manual work at my student assistant job, which can be automated. Therefore I aim to automate most of my work related to data augmentation and plotting.

GOALS: Monthly QC memo:

Write a program that copies the LIMS pull data into excel sheets of different rooms.
The program should be able to create excel plots from the copied data. Mold count:
Write a program which counts every single datapoint, and the number of data points containing mold.
